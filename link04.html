Doemens Academy Munich<br><br>
	
In 1895, Dr. Albert Doemens expressed his thoughts in the register of the newly founded Academy for Brewers in Munich concerning the education of its future students as follows:  They shall “be provided with the level of instruction and practical training necessary to acquire enough knowledge and competence that the skills essential for a successful career in the field of brewing become second nature to them".<br><br>

The clarity of Dr. Albert Doemens’ vision laid the foundation for the proud traditions still alive today, which have contributed to Doemens becoming an internationally recognized institution serving the brewing, beverage and food industries.<br><br>
 
The most significant milestones of the last several decades have included:<br><br>

    the founding of the non-profit organization of the Doemens School in 1965<br><br>
    dedication of the 5 hl teaching and laboratory brewery as well as the filling and packaging facilities of the Doemens Technikum<br><br>
    expansion of the Doemens Academy to a four semester technical school<br><br>
    federal accreditation of Doemens as a Fachakademie (technical academy) in 1992<br><br>
    1st training course "process manager beverage industry" in 1982<br><br>
    1st training course "process manager food industry" in 1989<br><br>
    1st training course "commercial manager beverage industry" in 1993<br><br>
    establishment of the World Brewing Academy (wba) in cooperation with the Chicago Siebel Institute in 2000
    introduction of the Internet distance learning program (web-based training: "Brewing Technology") in 2003
    1st training course "Beer Sommelier" in 2004<br><br>
    commissioning of the PET bottling and packaging line and the pilot draft system in 2009<br><br>

 

Since 1965, approximately two thousand graduates have received their qualifications from Doemens and are now holding responsible positions in companies in the brewing and beverage industriy in more than 80 countries around the world.<br><br>

Within the scope of the newly developed business plan, Doemens started off into the new millennium with customer-oriented strategic goals, new organization and management, a refreshed corporate design and a rejuvenated team. <br><br>
