Asahi Breweries, Ltd.  TYO: 2502 is a leading brewery and soft drink company based in Tokyo, Japan. The company has a 40% share of the Japanese beer market.<br><br>

The company's primary beer, from 1957 through the late 1980s, was Asahi Gold (overtaking Asahi Draft, its original formula, which remains in production). In 1987 it introduced Asahi Super Dry, which initiated the Japanese craze for dry beer; this led in turn to Asahi's dramatic turnaround in business performance, and its surpassing of former second ranker Sapporo Brewery in sales and profits.<br><br>



Asahi was founded in Osaka in 1889. During the First World War German prisoners worked in the brewery.<br><br>

In 1990, Asahi acquired a 19.9% stake in Australian brewery giant Elders IXL which has since become the Foster's Group.<br><br>

In 2009, Asahi acquired the Australian beverages unit of Cadbury Schweppes.
<br><br>
On January 23, 2009, Asahi acquired 19.9% of Tsingtao Brewery from Anheuser-Busch InBev for $667 million. The sale will make Asahi Breweries, Ltd. the second largest shareholder in Tsingtao behind only the Tsingtao Brewery Group.<br><br>

In July 2011, Asahi acquired New Zealand juice maker Charlie's and the water and juice divisions of Australian beverage company P&N Beverages.<br><br>

In August 2011, Asahi acquired New Zealand's Independent Liquor, maker of Vodka Cruiser and other alcoholic beverages, for Y97.6 billion. <br><br>
